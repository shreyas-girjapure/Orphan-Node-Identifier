## Problem Statement

While doing deployments with source based metadata , We overwrote some edges/targetReferences of elements. Now There were some elements left with no incoming edge but outgoing edge.

This made flow throw error when trying to AUTO-LAYOUT [FREE FORM SUCKS üòë]. Some of us already hate flows and freeform layout just makes developer experience even worse.

Solving for a really few people out there who are facing this beautiful error **one or more elements without an incoming connection.** and want to find out which nodes do not have incoming edge but have outgoing edge.

1. Get metadata of the flow you want to analyze with tooling API [Or Use salesforce inspector on flow detail page]
1. Make a `POST` request on https://flow-incoming-edge-analyzer.onrender.com/analyze
1. Add copied metadata into body.
1. **Hit it !!!!!!**
1. Based on analysis you should get array back in `result` tag. 
1. Result is list of nodes without incoming nodes but have outgoing edge.
