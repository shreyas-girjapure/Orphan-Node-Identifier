## Problem Statement

Flow metadata is alredy as unreadable as it could get , while doing regular flow deployments we overwrote some target references of elements and now flow was stuck in `Free-Form` layout with error `One or more elements without an incoming connection`. Upon further digging in found that `incoming edge /target references`  of 2-3 nodes was removed or changed to different node.

This discrepency in edges of flow makes flow layout `Free-Form` and prevents from changing to `AUTO-LAYOUT`. Some of us already hate flows and freeform layout just makes developer experience even worse.

Solving for a really few people out there who are facing this beautiful error `One or more elements without an incoming connection.` and want to find out which nodes do not have incoming edge but have outgoing edge.

1. Get metadata of the flow you want to analyze with tooling API [Or Use salesforce inspector on flow detail page]
1. Make a `POST` request on https://flow-incoming-edge-analyzer.onrender.com/analyze
1. Add copied metadata into body.
1. **Hit it !!!!!!**
1. Based on analysis you should get array back in `result` tag. 
1. Result is list of nodes without incoming nodes but have outgoing edge.
